Note: My Phong Shader in part A was not working in the build version and I did not have time to debug it. I inculded a video I recorded of it working as expected in editor with the build files.

Part A summary:
3 effects:
  - Vertex distortion (on the sphere)
  - Phong w/ Texture (on the cube)
  - Phong w/ 2 Blended Textures (faces and noise) (on the capsule)
Lights:
There is a red point light that moves with the sphere
There is a green point light which move back and forth horizontally
There is a directional light

Part B summary:
I adapted a version of the blur effect shown in class to affect the whole screen (as a screen shader). The intensity of the effect is controlled by moving the mouse left and right. It uses box blending.

Part C summary:
A cellular automata effect I came up with
